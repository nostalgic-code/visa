    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: January 9, 2026</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to VisaProAmahle.co.za. By accessing or using our website and services (the "Service"), you agree to these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use this Service.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>VisaProAmahle.co.za ("we", "us", "our") provides visa application assistance, consultancy, documentation support and related advisory services. We do not issue visas — final approval is determined by the relevant embassy, consulate, or immigration authority.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate, complete, and current information when using our Service.</li>
      <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes and not to misrepresent yourself or your documentation.</li>
      <li>Be responsible for all activity under your account.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old. By using our Service, you represent that you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Service Fees & Payments</h2>
    <p>All fees are clearly quoted before purchase or engagement. Fees are non-refundable once services are rendered, including preparatory work, document review, or submission support. Any embassy fees, government levies, or third-party charges are separate and beyond our control.</p>
    
    <h2>5. No Guarantee of Results</h2>
    <p>We assist with application preparation, advice, and submissions — we do NOT guarantee approval of visas, entry permits, or any outcome with immigration authorities.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content on this website (text, logos, graphics, software) is the property of VisaProAmahle or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or republish any content without written permission.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms or for operational reasons. Your obligations and disclaimers survive termination.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa.</p>
